synopsis: >-
  The Wellbeing Café will run every month and warmly welcomes anyone over the age of 16 to come along relax, chat, have a cuppa and find out more about the Belfast Recovery College. There is no fee to join and the coffee is free.
  
  
  A peer educator will also be there to help explain the courses available.
  
  
  If you so wish feel free to bring your favourite book or a board game you enjoy (optional) or if you just prefer a coffee/tea and a natter in a warm welcoming environment we offer that too!
