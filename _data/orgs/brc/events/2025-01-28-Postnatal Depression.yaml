synopsis: >-
  After having a baby it is normal to feel overwhelmed with the responsibility of this little person totally dependent on you.  This course will explore when it is more than the ‘baby blues’ and is potentially leading to a more serious mental health condition. It will help you develop an understanding of what postnatal depression is (PND).  It will also explore the symptoms of PND and the various treatment options and support networks available.  If you or someone you know may be struggling with PND this course may be useful for you.
