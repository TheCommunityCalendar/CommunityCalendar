  Are you interested in learning more about a peer educator role in the Belfast Trust Recovery College in mental health services? You may be interested in applying to become a peer educator when jobs are advertised but would like to find out more about this type of role first.  This 1.5hr session will explore what the role of a peer educator is, the application process and give an opportunity to explore whether or not you may be ready for the job role. You will also look at what you can do to develop the training and experience you may need. You can also decide if this role is for you. The session will be of interest to those applying for job opportunities advertised for full-time, part-time or Bank roles in the Belfast HSC Trust. The Recovery College prospectus also provides Job Skills and IT for the Terrified courses which are aimed at developing skills in completing job applications including on-line and preparation for interviews.
