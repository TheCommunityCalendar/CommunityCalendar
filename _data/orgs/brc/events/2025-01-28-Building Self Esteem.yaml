synopsis: >-
  Many of us struggle with self-esteem issues and self-confidence daily. This can hold us back and keep us stuck in a very isolated place. We tend to take our self-worth from others and their opinion of us instead of believing in our own value and worth as a unique individual. Please join us where we can all learn and develop skills and knowledge. You will be involved in conversations where you will feel comfortable in the course to understand how important it is to value yourself and not let judgement of others hold us back.
