synopsis: >-
  Resilience is how we adapt in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or sources of stress. By working out what we find stressful and by building on our inner strength we are more likely to be able to adapt to these sources of stress. Someone who is resilient has the knowledge, skills and attitude that help maintain their wellbeing. This course explores the benefits and barriers to becoming more resilient and how we can support ourselves.
