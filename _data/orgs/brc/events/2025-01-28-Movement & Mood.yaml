  We are all told to exercise daily, but why? This course aims to explore the positive effects of physical activity on your mental wellbeing. The course will provide information on incorporating movement into our daily routine and provide signposting on how to get yourself involved in physical activity both in your own home and in the community. This course is informative, interactive and we look forward to seeing you there.
