synopsis: >-
  Music and Wellbeing Studies on mood and music reports suggest that music and wellbeing programmes can be designed to achieve goals such as managing stress, enhancing memory, and alleviating pain. Music helps us engage with our emotions, it helps with our memories, reunites, and can create neural connections in our brains. Music has the power to draw our attention away from adversities which in turn gives us hope.
