synopsis: >-
  Stress affects us all and in very different ways. The right amount of stress can be a motivating factor for change or to keep us stimulated. But too much stress can be debilitating and adversely affect our mental and physical health and wellbeing. This course will explore what stress is, its causes and how it can affect us. Students will examine ways of overcoming stress should it become too much and identify different coping strategies for managing stress.
