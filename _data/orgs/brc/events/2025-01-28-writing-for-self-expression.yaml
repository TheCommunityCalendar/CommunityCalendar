synopsis: >-
  On this course, co-produced in partnership with the Royal Literary Fund, we reflect on how words affect us, how we use them and how they can help us to explain ourselves to ourselves.  Through the shared reading and discussion of a poem or short piece of prose, we look at how writing can capture a mood, feeling or memory. We then encourage participants to do their own writing, often based on ideas from the poem or prose.  And finally, we listen to what participants have written, if they want to share, and tease out how writing can produce enlightening new insights and change the way we think about ourselves and each other. 
  
  
  You donâ€™t need any experience of writing to do this course.
