synopsis: >-
  Menopause is a major physical, mental and emotional transitional time in a womanâ€™s life.  Some women find the transition fairly straightforward, whilst for others it can be a time of intense challenges.  The key message is that no woman experiences the transition the same.  It is a unique and personal journey. This programme aims to provide you with up to date information on the menopause, its signs, symptoms, and ways to manage it.  It will focus on the physical and mental health aspects of menopause and aims to inform and empower you as you navigate your own very unique menopausal journey.  
  
  
  It will help you understand and manage your psychological and emotional reactions to help live well with the menopause, know that there are things we can do and how to access support. 
  
  
  The course is open to everyone as we all need to learn more about this area to give ourselves compassion and give compassion to others.
