synopsis: >-
  We all have hopes and dreams and sometimes life can get in the way of making these dreams a reality. When you have been diagnosed with a mental health condition the impact can be overwhelming for you and a loved one. Too often people think they will not fulfil their hopes, ambitions or aspirations. This course gives the opportunity to explore the concept of recovery in our day to day lives as it unique to them. It will provide space for you to reflect on what might help you grow beyond what has happened and take a step on your recovery journey to rebuild a satisfying, valued and purposeful life. The course can also help us think about embedding hope in our lives and learn about opportunities available to us that can assist us in making that that step to living well with or without the symptoms of mental ill health.
