synopsis: >-
  Do you ever feel as though your opinions arenâ€™t heard, or that people readily dismiss or undermine your views? Maybe you have a habit of handling
  
  
  Situations aggressively, lack the confidence to speak up or find it hard to express your needs and wishes.
  
  
  This course aims to help you develop skills to communicate better with others respectfully and with compassion. We will explore appropriate assertiveness techniques to enable students to engage in better conversations and achieve better outcomes for yourself and others.
