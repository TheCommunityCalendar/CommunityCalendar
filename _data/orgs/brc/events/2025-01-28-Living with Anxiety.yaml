  This course will help you develop an understanding of what anxiety is, why we experience it, and how it may affect us. We also explore practical strategies to manage anxiety, including basic cognitive behavioural and relaxation techniques. If you or someone you know struggles with anxiety or panic, including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, this course may be useful for you.
