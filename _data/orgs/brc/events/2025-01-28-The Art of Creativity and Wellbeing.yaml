synopsis: >-
  The aim of this course is to welcome and encourage curiosity through exploring how art and creative energy can improve your mental and physical health and wellbeing. The course provides a learning opportunity to dip your toe in the water and try art and creativity as a wellbeing tool and see if it is for you. Mental health is not always about being happy all the time. It is about developing resilience, recovering from the peaks and valleys that are inevitable in life and gaining personal growth in learning and experiencing different ways to keep well.  You do not have to be a professional artist or have any prior experience in art or crafts. You are invited to enrol in a class with a relaxed and informal atmosphere, have a bit of fun and the opportunity to make new connections with other students learning together.
