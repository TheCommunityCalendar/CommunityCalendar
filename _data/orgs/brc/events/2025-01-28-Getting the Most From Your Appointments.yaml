synopsis: >-
  This course will enable service users, carers and mental health practitioners to effectively prepare for and manage appointments, both face to face and virtual. We explore what we can do before, during and after the stages of the appointment process and to gain the knowledge of what may contribute or hinder effective appointments. The course will also explore such areas as anxiety, confidence and assertiveness and how these can impact the success of appointments.
