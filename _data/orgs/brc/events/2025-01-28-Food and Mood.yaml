  The relationship between our diet and our mental health is complex. However, research shows a link between what we eat and how we feel.  Certain foods and nutrients help your brain to make chemicals that can impact your mood, attention and focus, while other foods can zap your energy. Eating well can help you feel better.
  
  
  During this course we explore the relationship between what you eat and how you feel, including tips on how to introduce healthy eating into your life.
