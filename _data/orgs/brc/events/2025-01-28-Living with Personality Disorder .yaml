synopsis: >-
  If you have heard the term Personality Disorder from a Doctor, Psychiatrist or Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) you might be left wondering what it actually means.  This workshop is aimed at helping service users, mental health practitioners and carers understand what is meant by “personality disorder”. We will look at some of the myths and misconceptions we might have as well as increasing awareness of the struggles of living with a personality disorder. We also want to give people a chance to learn about some of the treatment options for people who have a diagnosis and how to help someone you know with a personality disorder.
